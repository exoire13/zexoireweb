            <h3 class="align-self-start"><b>Auto-Moderation</b></h3>
            <p>
            We have an auto-moderation system which can track words. The thing is it's not currently customizable. Pretty soon you will be able to customize the auto-moderation with the banned words and such.

            <h3><b>Moderation Logs</b></h3>
            <p>
           Tons of things to configure including mod logs. Audit-logs are not currently customizable but you can make a channel named zex-logs. And it will automatically put audit logs into there.
